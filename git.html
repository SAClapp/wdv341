    <h3>Terms Defined:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Version Control Software:</strong> is used as a way for users to track changes to<br>
            source code and observe all changes made to source code over time.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Add:</strong> the command <em>$git add filename.ext</em> tells the git version control software or vcs that<br>
                a file is important and gets it ready to commit the file. For example if I wanted to add this page to my git I<br>
                would say <em>$git add git.html</em> and it would be added to the list of files that I want to have ready for my next commit.
            </li>
     
            <li>
                <strong>Commit:</strong> the command <em>$git commit -m "insert message here"</em> tells git that the committed files <br>
                are ready to be backed up to your remote repository. When doing this you should also put a message in quotes after the<br>
                -m to help keep track of which version of your file or files is being committed.<br>
                 For example I would do <em>$git commit -m "First version of git.html"</em>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Push:</strong> the command <em>$git push origin master</em> moves committed files to your remote repository.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Pull:</strong> the command <em>$git pull</em> updates parts your local repository with changes made on your remote<br>
                repository. In other words it helps you keep your local repositories current with updates you or others may have made to files<br>
                on your remote repositories.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Clone:</strong> the command <em>$git clone</em> creates a copy of an entire repository within a repository.
            </li>
    </ul>
